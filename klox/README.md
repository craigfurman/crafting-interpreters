# klox

My attempt at the tree-walk interpreter from Crafting Interpreters, in Kotlin. The book does this in Java, but I wanted
to learn a new language while doing it. My Java was very rusty anyway, so expect this to look a bit weird.

Includes some extensions. Some are challenge exercise from the book, some aren't:

* break statements
* pipe expressions (e.g. `1 | add(2)`)
* List class, with some sugar for literals and access
